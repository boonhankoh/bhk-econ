For predicting what the leader chose, it was easy to go with Investment X probability 0 for the 250-50 and 200-0 case. For the 300-50 case, I didn't know how risk neutral the leader would be, so I had to make a gut decision there. I thought many people are more risk-averse than I am in these kinds of experiments, so I went with a gut feeling of 70%. The ideal way would be to calculate the Sharpe ratio/""risk"" (expected payoff divided by variance or std deviation) and use their ratio to determine the percentage, but I didn't have time to calculate and implement that in my Google Sheets.     For predicting what the leader chose given that the investment has succeeded or given that the experiment has failed, I wanted to use Bayes' formula, but I couldn't calculate it in time, so I just did 75% * probability that I think investment X was chosen + 25% * probability that I think investment Y was chosen for part 2(a) and switch 75% and 25% for part 2(b)",1,0,0,0,0,I described everything in a previous part of the questionnaire.,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,12,38,38,0,,0,1,1,2o3btpnv,201013 Session 3,,,Session 9 SM,0
