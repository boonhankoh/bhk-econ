1) The "Experimental Program" folder contains the required z-Tree (Exp 1) and otree software files.

For Experiment 1, the program was run on z-Tree version 3.5.1.

For Experiment 2, the program was run on otree version 3.0.5.

2) The "Raw Session Files" folder contains all the raw data files generated from the z-Tree (Exp 1) and otree (Exp 2) software. Folders are appropriately named to reflect the dates in which the sessions were run (in YYMMDD format).

3) The "STATA" folder contains the files necessary to replicate all the results reported in the paper (including the Online Appendix).

Within this folder, the "1-RawData" folder contains the essential raw datafiles obtained from the z-Tree and otree session files (see #1). The "Data" folder contains the processed datasets (in .dta format) made suitable for analysis.

Note that all variables in the processed STATA datasets are labelled in a way that are self-explanatory. STATA 16 was used for all analysis.

The "an-paper.do" file in the "2-doFiles" folder contains all the STATA codes required to reproduce all figures, tables, and statistical tests reported in the paper and the Online Appendix.
